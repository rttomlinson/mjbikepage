On the slider, just use the helmet image for every slide. There should be as
many slides as there are blue pluses.

When hovering over the blue plus, use a generic title for a hover effect 
(Smith Bike Helmet). 

When clicking on the blue plus, it should move the slider to that slide, when 
clicking previous and next, it should go to the previous and next slide, and the
title of the blue plus should pop up. 

Use any hover effects and be as creative as you want.
